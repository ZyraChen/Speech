      "feedback": "The speech script is well-structured and effectively conveys the key points of the presentation. The speaker clearly explains the motivation behind the research, focusing on the practical application of web search to enhance fact-checking for LLMs. The example provided (EMNLP and Andy Lau) is engaging and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. However, there are a few areas for improvement: the script could benefit from more concise language in certain parts, particularly when discussing the limitations of web search (e.g., niche information, dynamic content). Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by summarizing the broader implications of the research or suggesting future directions. Overall, the script is clear and informative, but with some refinement, it could achieve a higher level of impact."

    "coherence": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "raw_score": 8,
      "feedback": "The speech script demonstrates strong logical coherence, with a clear progression from introducing the problem (LLM hallucinations) to explaining the motivation and methodology of the research. The speaker effectively connects the slide content to the narrative, maintaining a well-structured flow that guides the audience through the key points. The example provided is particularly effective in illustrating the practical application of the web-augmented approach, making the concept more tangible. However, the script could benefit from slightly more emphasis on the broader implications of the research, such as how this method might address larger societal challenges or contribute to the field of AI ethics. Additionally, the final sentence is cut off, which disrupts the flow and leaves the audience hanging. Overall, the script is well-crafted but could be strengthened with a more complete conclusion."

      "feedback": "The speech script effectively aligns with the slide content, particularly in addressing the core problem of LLM hallucinations and the motivation behind using web search for fact-checking. The example provided (EMNLP and Andy Lau) is relevant and demonstrates the practical application of the proposed method. However, the script could be improved by elaborating more on the challenges of web search mentioned in the slides (e.g., niche information, dynamic data, conflicting sources) to provide a deeper understanding of the context. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by summarizing the key takeaways or future directions of the research."

    "fluency": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "raw_score": 8,
      "feedback": "The speech script is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear progression from introducing the problem to presenting the motivation and examples. The language is natural and engaging, making complex ideas accessible to the audience. However, there are minor areas for improvement: some sentences could be slightly more concise (e.g., 'This is the space we're exploring' could be trimmed), and the final sentence is cut off, leaving the conclusion incomplete. Overall, the fluency and clarity are strong, but tightening the phrasing and ensuring a complete ending would elevate the script further."
