It begins with a clear introduction, highlighting the challenges posed by LLM hallucinations and the motivation behind the research. The examples provided are relevant and help illustrate the variability in LLM outputs, emphasizing the need for robust fact-checking mechanisms. However, the script could benefit from more detailed explanations of the web search challenges mentioned on Slide 7 (e.g., niche information, dynamic information, conflict among multi-source information, and interference from low-quality content). Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by summarizing the key takeaways and potential future directions of the research."

      "feedback": "The speech script demonstrates strong logical coherence, with a clear progression from introducing the problem of LLM hallucinations to presenting the motivation and methodology of the research. The examples provided effectively illustrate the challenges faced by LLMs and the benefits of integrating web search for fact-checking. However, the script could be improved by elaborating more on the specific argumentative reasoning techniques used in the research and how they contribute to enhancing fact-checking accuracy. Additionally, the conclusion could summarize the broader implications of the research for AI systems and society."

      "feedback": "The speech script effectively addresses the key points of the slide content, particularly focusing on the challenges of LLM hallucinations and the motivation behind integrating web search for fact-checking. The examples provided (EMNLP 2024 location, 程立's position at 蚂蚁集团, and the music query) are relevant and illustrate the variability in LLM outputs and the need for robust fact-checking mechanisms. However, the script could be improved by elaborating more on the specific role of argumentative reasoning in enhancing fact-checking processes, as mentioned in the title. Additionally, the last example about the music query is cut off, which slightly disrupts the flow and completeness of the presentation."

      "feedback": "The speech script is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear focus on the challenges of LLM fact-checking and the proposed solution. The language is natural and accessible, making it suitable for a general audience. However, there are minor areas for improvement: some sentences could be slightly more concise, and the transition between examples (e.g., EMNLP 2024 and 程立's position) could be smoother to maintain flow. Overall, the script effectively communicates the key points without overwhelming the listener."
